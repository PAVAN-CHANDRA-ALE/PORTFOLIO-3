<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am excited to apply for the software developer Intern position in your
  organization. As a highly motivated and enthusiastic developer, I have
  experience in various programming languages including Python, C++, and web
  development technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I am passionate
  about data structures and algorithm development and am always eager to learn
  new technologies. </p>
  <p>I am Studying my B.E in Electronics and Communication
  Engineering with a 7.0 GPA, where I focused on digital electronics, analog
  electronics, Python programming, data structures, compilers, and algorithms.
  In addition, I have completed courses in web development, C++, Oops, and DSA
  from Udemy. I am also proficient in English, Telugu, and Hindi. I have worked
  on various projects, including an Automatic Medicine Reminder that provides
  reminders, alerts, and notifications to users when it is time to take their
  medication.</p>
  <p>I have also completed an internship in Robotic Process Automation
  at UiPATH, where I learned to automate repetitive tasks and workflows within a
  GUI environment, and another internship in AI constraint satisfaction at
  NPTEL. In addition to my technical skills, I enjoy problem-solving, staying
  updated on new technologies, and surfing the internet. I am confident that my
  skills and experience align with the requirements of the Software Developer
